- Definition: Cloning creates a local copy of a repository (including all files, branches, and commit history) on your machine.
- Purpose: Enables offline work, experimentation, and pushing changes back to the remote.
- Command: git clone <repo-url>
- Note: Unlike a fork, cloning doesn’t create a new repo on GitHub—it just copies it locally.
