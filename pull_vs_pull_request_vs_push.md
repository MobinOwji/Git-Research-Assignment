- Pull:
When you run git pull, you’re asking Git to fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch. It’s essentially a shortcut for git fetch followed by git merge. This keeps your local copy up to date with the latest work from others.
- Push:
git push sends your local commits to the remote repository. It’s the opposite of pull: instead of bringing changes down, you’re pushing your work up so that others can access it. Without pushing, your changes remain only on your machine.
- Pull Request (PR):
A pull request is not a Git command but a GitHub feature. It’s a request to merge your changes from one branch (often in your fork or feature branch) into another branch of a repository (usually the main branch of the original project). PRs allow for code review, discussion, and automated checks before the changes are accepted.
