- Fork:
- GitHub creates a new repository object on its servers.
- It copies all code, branches, and history.
- GitHub tracks the relationship between the fork and the original (upstream) repo, enabling PRs.

- Clone:
- Git copies the entire repository (objects, refs, commit history) to your local machine.
- Remote-tracking branches (refs/remotes/origin/*) are set up.
- You can fetch, pull, and push to keep your local copy in sync.

- Key Difference: Fork is a GitHub concept (server-side copy), while clone is a Git concept (local copy).
